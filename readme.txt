Adds links to the top of the user profile page for each of the sections in the profile.

== Description ==

Have a lot of options in your user profile page and are tired of scrolling down through them to get to the one you want?  Profile Links creates a jump list at the top of the page of all the option groups in your profile.  It also converts each heading in to a jump back to the top of the page.

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the profile-links folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't an option group for a plugin show up in the jump list? =

Profile Links generates the jump list based on the H3 tags it finds in the profile page.  If a plugin has used something other than an H3 tag Profile Links won't find it.
